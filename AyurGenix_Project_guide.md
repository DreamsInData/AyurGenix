## 🧮 Weighted Scoring Logic

Each option assigns:

Final Calculation:

```
Total points → Normalize to %
```

Kapha: 20%
Dominant: Vata-Pitta
```

## 🔎 NEW: Confidence Score System

Since Prakriti needs depth:

Display:

Confidence Level: 82%
Recommendation: Retake after 7 days for improved accuracy.
```
